Surf and Ice Cream Shop Analysis for Oahu

## Purpose
#### W. Any likes our analysis but wants more info about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. He wants to know temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round. We will be creating summary of the statistics for June and a separate summary for December. We will also be delivering a written report for the statistical analyses that is included in this README file.

## Analysis
#### To understand the differences between June and December, I have provided graphs of both months data below. The first being June and the second being December.
> Before we begin our analysis, we should gather the data and charts at our disposal. We have put together histograms and descriptive statistics for both June and December. We should use the charts to observe any obvious behaviors, and reference the descriptive stats to support/reject our hypothesis.

> We also need to understand that I am comparing the 2 months to determine which is better in regards to temperature. If it is an ice cream and surf shop, I would associate better with warmer. Therefore we are going to assume that we are comparing June vs. December to determine which would have better weather according to the criteria I detailed above.
* 1. The number of temperatures recorded is relatively equal for both months with December having 12 % less recordings to analyze than June. I would be concerned if it were greater than 20% difference.
* 2. The mean for June is 74 degrees and the mean for December is 71. Those are within 5% of eachother and without feeling what those temperatures there actually feel like, I cannot say that the difference is statistically significant.
* 3. The top 75% of June is still more than 50% of December. I can see this by referencing the bottom quartile's numbers. June's bottom quartile is 73 degrees making the temperature at or greater than 73 degrees 75% of the time. The mean is 75 degrees.  December has a lower quartile of 69 degrees, and a mean of 71 degrees. June therefore has a hotter lower quartile than December, so 75% of the time June will be at or above 73 degrees, where as December will only be at or above 73 degrees maybe 30/40% of the month.
* 4. The standard deviation supports our belief in June being the superior month. June has a lower standard deviation than December, meaning there is less likely to be a large variance in June, where as its slightly more likely to have variance in December. 3.26 in June vs. 3.75 in December.
* 5. Therefore from the data, and from personal experience, we can conclude that June would have better weather more frequently than December would.
