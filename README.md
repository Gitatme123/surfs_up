Surf and Ice Cream Shop Analysis for Oahu

## Purpose
#### W. Any likes our analysis but wants more info about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. He wants to know temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round. We will be creating summary of the statistics for June and a separate summary for December. We will also be delivering a written report for the statistical analyses that is included in this README file.

## Analysis
#### To understand the differences between June and December, I have provided graphs of both months data below. The first being June and the second being December.
Before we begin our analysis, we should gather the data and charts at our disposal. We have put together histograms and descriptive statistics for both June and December. We should use the charts to observe any obvious behaviors, and reference the descriptive stats to support/reject our hypothesis.
1. The number of temperatures recorded is relatively equal for both months with December having 12 % less recordings to analyze than June. I would be concerned if it were greater than 20% difference.
2. The mean for June is 74 degrees and the mean for December is 71. Those are within 5% of eachother and without feeling what those temperatures there actually feel like, I cannot say that the difference is statistically significant.
3. From personal experience, any place with 50% of the days being around or less than 70 degrees would feel cold and not warrant an outdoor experience. The mean for June is right around 74 degrees wich i would call the very bottom of what could be deemed an excellent temperature to enjoy ice cream or go surfing.

> We can clearly see that June has the highest concentration of recorded temperatures between 68 and 78. We can then reference the descriptive stats from our code to
